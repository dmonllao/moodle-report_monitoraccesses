Allow users (new capability defined report/monitoraccesses:view, available to admins by default) to 
monitor accesses of the selected users from the selected courses between the selected 
time ranges (until 3) and the selected days of the year. It counts the time each selected user has passed 
connected to Moodle between the selected ranges, if the user didn't logout it considers the (login + session
timeout) as logout time.

The necessary queries to extract the data could take a lot of time depending on number of users/usage of 
the Moodle installation.
